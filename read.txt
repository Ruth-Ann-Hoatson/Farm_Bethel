Hello there, 

Welcome to my second portfolio of work. 
In this website , I made use of HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT in order to showcase
my knowledge in all three languages. 

This was a very enjoyable project to work on as it allowed for large amounts of animation.
I have not made use of online libaries for this project as I wanted to show that I am able 
to create a website without the assistance of online libaries such as Bootstrap.I did use
fontAwesome for the icons found on the 'contact page'.

This website has 5 pages which include:
1.index.html  ( main / home page)
2.about,html:
This page will hopefully enlighten you on macadamia trees and some of the processes involved
with this type of farming.
3.team.html
This page will tell you a little bit about the team involved with this particular farm.
4.gallery.html
This page will serve to showcase a gallery of images from the farm itself. 
contact.html
This page serves to show the front-end developer skills I have acquired to create a contact form with 
elements of interactivity.


Styling and interactivity:
design.css 
design.js

Responsiveness:
I have made use of media queries and google chromes developer tools to ensure that
my website works effectively on multiple devices.

Images: 
Images can be located in the 'images' file within this main 'BETHEL FARM' file.
