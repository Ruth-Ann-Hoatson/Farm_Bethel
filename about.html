        This farm was first owned by Robert Hoatson in the November 
        of 2013. It is a sixteen hectare farm. This is a small farm
         in comparison to other farms such as the ones in the sugar cane field.
        Forutnately macadmaia's have a high  ROI due to the low amount of staff needed.
        Macadmaia's are known as a long term crop as they take a long period of time
         before they start bearing fruit.The period of time required before fruit begins to grow is
         dependant on the tree variety one has planted. This farm has two varietys. 
         One named NelMac and  another 816's. There are many other varietys in this particular farming 
         field that farmers should look into before making a decision. 
         A strict spraying schedule needs to be followed in order for the trees to produce 
         the desired amount of nuts per season.Farmers work in seasons as apposed to annual years due to 
         the weather changes which affect the crops yielding.
